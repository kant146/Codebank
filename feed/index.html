<p>There are hundreds of ways that can help you in building website conversion, but we will guide you to the most prior one. Landing page. Or, “lead-capture pages” as it is often called, is where most of your potential customers drop by. It is most useful for website conversion.</p>



<h4>Quality, not Quantity</h4>



<p>Only deliver the critical information your viewers will need to proceed with the page. Limit the quantity and increase the quality of your content so that your visitors scan through the page fast but understand it all the way through.</p>



<h4>Effective Headlines</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="572" src="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-post-1024x572.png" alt="" class="wp-image-25262" srcset="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-post-1024x572.png 1024w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-post-300x168.png 300w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-post-768x429.png 768w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-post-1536x858.png 1536w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/1-post-2048x1144.png 2048w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Headlines are the attention grabbers. Make sure that your headlines on the landing page speak directly to your viewers and don’t drive you away from the CTA you are providing. Indian serial entrepreneur <a href="https://thinksurfmedia.com/cred-the-showstopper-of-emerging-fintechs-in-india/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kunal Shah has projected this “less is more” strategy</a> by their minimalistic headlines and banners.</p>



<h4>Comprehensible CTA</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="450" src="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-post-1024x450.png" alt="" class="wp-image-25263" srcset="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-post-1024x450.png 1024w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-post-300x132.png 300w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-post-768x338.png 768w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/2-post.png 1265w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>CTAs play a huge role for your visitor as it is the navigator in your landing page. The bigger and comprehensive the CTA is, the more engaged will your visitor feel. Readability is the most intriguing factor. You need to think of everyone as your visitor; so make sure the ones with special needs of understanding a text are not left alone. There are special fonts available for dyslexic people as well as font sizes.</p>



<h4>Persuasive Questionnaire</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="573" src="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-post-1024x573.png" alt="" class="wp-image-25264" srcset="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-post-1024x573.png 1024w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-post-300x168.png 300w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-post-768x430.png 768w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/3-post.png 1420w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Ask only the needful. The visitor grows impatient when they are asked things that are not related to the headlines. Don’t forget to highlight the value of the service you are offering, and put as many questions as you can, but make sure to put the needed ones only.</p>



<h4>Appear Shorter</h4>



<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M%C3%BCller-Lyer_illusion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Muller-Lyer Illusion</a> or the psychological technique where you can make the subject appear shorter than its real size or height. With this optical illusion channeled onto your landing page making, it ensures the visitors see the landing page as short as they want it to be. For instance, you should not leave a lot of space in between the fields. It will make your visitor’s eyes congested.</p>



<h4>Relevant Media</h4>



<p>Usage of to-the-point media that entails your headlines is the key to making your visitors stay on your page and increase the leads. Don’t forget to highlight the value of the service you are offering, and reduce the amount of extravagant media on the page.</p>



<h4>Decent Layouts</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="538" src="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-post-1024x538.png" alt="" class="wp-image-25265" srcset="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-post-1024x538.png 1024w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-post-300x158.png 300w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-post-768x403.png 768w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/4-post.png 1200w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<p>Design the layout of your landing page in order of age. <a href="https://www.statista.com/topics/779/mobile-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">According to an analysis of 2020</a>, over 90 percent of the internet surfers, use more mobile phones. So make sure you have all the layouts (i.e. desktop, mobile, tab) ready beforehand. So that the visitor faces zero inconveniences.</p>



<h4>Encouragement</h4>



<p>Eliminate all confusion. To keep up with the visitor’s trust, you need to be careful to provide the offer your headline directed them to your landing page. Make sure your landing page compellingly reflects on the service provided the visitors are looking for.</p>



<h4>Better Landing Page = Better Website Conversion</h4>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="600" height="358" src="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-post.png" alt="" class="wp-image-25266" srcset="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-post.png 600w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/5-post-300x179.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></figure>



<p>The above elements are essentials for designing an effective landing page. And once that is done, we recommend you to always keep improvising. Improvising your landing page will serve you the best results.</p>



<p>Landing pages can feel prodigious to create but the result is what will speak.</p>

<p>Bringing science to the betterment of society is what Cadbury has been doing since last Diwali. ‘NotJustACadburyAd’ Campaign this year too melted the hearts of millions and brought tears to our eyes. We witnessed Cadbury take a purge in sharing not just sweets but also smiles with absolutely everyone across the country!</p>



<h4>Celebrating With the People!</h4>



<p>The COVID-19 pandemic has been disastrous to the small businessmen and women of India. With over 6 crores of small businesses breaking down in a Keynesian tailspin fashion, the base of their optimism was shaken to the core. Diwali seemed no bright last year. Just then, like a rift in a dark cave, released Cadbury their ‘most generous ad, and called it ‘NotJustACadburyAd’.</p>



<p>It featured actors who promoted the names of the local shops which could be adhered to the products shown in the ad. Many small shops found the strategy life-saving as the lockdowns were increasingly taking place in the country. Nobody thought the prediction of the Second Wave will crush India’s shores so much so that the periodical lockdown would become a necessity.</p>



<p>This year, Cadbury released another special ad featuring a very special face and represented a very special way of celebrating Diwali 2021.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"><div class="wp-block-embed__wrapper">
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Supporting Local Retailers This Diwali | Not Just A Cadbury Ad Campaign Video" width="800" height="450" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5WECsbqAQSk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</div></figure>



<h4>How Can You Make Your Ad Featuring The One and Only?</h4>



<p>It’s very simple. All you have to do is go to their <a href="http://notjustacadburyad.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">website</a>&nbsp;and fill in the whereabouts of your shop and it will create you a hyper-personalized video where “India’s biggest brand ambassador” Shah Rukh Khan will promote your local shop. The promotional video will then be sent to the users’ WhatsApp in about 30 minutes! Impressive, right?</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><img loading="lazy" width="1024" height="465" src="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-1024x465.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21594" srcset="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-1024x465.png 1024w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-300x136.png 300w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-768x349.png 768w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-1536x698.png 1536w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-500x227.png 500w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-800x364.png 800w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1-1280x582.png 1280w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/1.png 1886w" sizes="(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px" /></figure>



<h4>Stunning Concept But How Was It Designed?</h4>



<p>As it is nearly impossible for the actor and the production to feature every single shop and make different promotional videos for each shop owner, technology lifts the sword! With the help of&nbsp;<em>Machine Learning</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Artificial Intelligence</em>, the actor’s voice and facial movements were recreated to promote the names of the local stores. The algorithm narrows down by the Pin Code of viewers watching and shows them the shops that are only nearby.</p>



<h4>A Very Sweet Note!</h4>



<p>The initiative to promote local stores that get no representation in the digital world for the lack of resources is a great step forward towards humanity! This Diwali, Cadbury Celebration advertises effortlessly with their thoughtful campaign and wins our hearts, yet again.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-full"><img loading="lazy" width="730" height="395" src="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2.png" alt="" class="wp-image-21595" srcset="https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2.png 730w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2-300x162.png 300w, https://thinksurfmedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/2-500x271.png 500w" sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" /></figure>

<p>Advertisements have a great impact on our minds and ultimately affect our buying behaviour. We love them, criticize them, and share them a lot in the process. Up next are a few such ads that went viral in 2021 and we are living for it!</p>



<h4>Signal-ling A Paradigmatic Shift</h4>



<p>Just when Facebook HQ was worried about the privacy concerns raised against them, Signal launched their thoughtfully crafted social campaigns solely directed towards the importance of &#8220;Privacy&#8221;. Endorsements sprinkled by Elon Musk and Edward Snowden, of course, the shift took the world by storm. And people could see why it was the best option out of the two, hence a wave of more than 7 million downloads was observed in a week&#8217;s duration since WhatsApp&#8217;s leaks in their privacy policy. Telegram, another end-to-end encrypted cloud messaging app received millions of downloads in the wail of keeping the world&#8217;s data private.</p>

<h4>Have You Met, CRED Yet?</h4>



<p>CRED has always provoked the mass with its not-so-subtle advertising! This year, we all witnessed how CRED did it with their humour. The casting of renowned faces at their unusual played the trump card. Be it the Indian cricketer Rahul Dravid at his most aggressive behaviour stuck in traffic throwing his &#8220;Bats in the air&#8221; (pun intended), or the unthinkable casting of the Olympics gold medalist Neeraj Chopra &#8211; stunned the most of us!</p>

<h4>Driving Around With Timothee Scissorhands</h4>



<p>An ode to the Tim Buton&#8217;s classic tale of &#8220;Edward Scissorhands&#8221; &#8211; the epoch Cadillac&#8217;s ad on its brand new Lyriq series this SuperBowl season took many of us down the memory lane. The commercial could be seen as a sequel of the film as Winona Ryder reprises her role, playing Kim Boggs again. Starring Timothee Chalamet as her and Edward&#8217;s son &#8211; as Edgar Scissorhands. Come on, we weren&#8217;t the only ones to shed a tear when Kim showed Edgard the only thing where his peculiar hands won&#8217;t come in the way.</p>

<h4>Fumble, Said Apple</h4>



<p>As always, Apple stands out with a commercial for its iPhone 12. To promote the durability of the iPhone 12 and its Ceramic Shield, Apple plays an unforgettable Indian classical beat &#8212; ‘The Conference’ by musician Nitin Sawhney. In the ad, we see a lady fumble and try her best not to let the iPhone fall onto the pavement but fails. Cut to a scene where irrespective of the terrible fall the phone’s screen is intact and she is relieved to see the phone in one piece. The sequence stays imprinted on your memory long after the 38-second ad is over!</p>

<h4>Hon&#8217;ble mentions</h4>



<p><strong>The Shower</strong> directed by Bauddhayan Mukherji &amp; <strong>The Letter</strong> directed by Aarsha Mukherji</p>



<p>This year at Moscow’s Lampa Film Festival, an unusual coincidence took place as two Mukherji&#8217;s from the same family won awards in two different categories. Father Bauddhayan Mukherji and daughter Aarsha Mukherji for their ad films &#8220;The Shower&#8221; and &#8220;The Letter&#8221; won awards respectively. Where Mr Mukherji&#8217;s The Shower shows the negligence behind water waste, her daughter projects the humans&#8217; ruthless behaviour to Mother Earth that causes us horrible natural calamities.</p>



<p>Bauddhayan&#8217;s &#8220;The Shower&#8221; is the first Indian ad film to get a National Award. &#8220;The Letter&#8221; was chosen by UNICEF to release on Children&#8217;s Day across Maharashtra last year. It was also awarded for films made by children at the Psaroloco Film Festival in Greece in August.</p>

<h4>Aaand CUT!</h4>



<p>2021 has stood out as another step up in the advertising industry. Some bagged awards, some gathered controversy, whereas some films ended up being meme templates and were conversation starters! Creativity prospers in different ways. Especially, when we are living in the digital era only can we wholeheartedly agree to that.</p>

<p>In India, where the idea of &#8220;Borrowings&#8221; is nearly tabooed has observed a constant rise in recent times which is commendable. The founder Mr. Kunal Shah, who by making CRED the sixth and the only Indian startup to enter the 2021 unicorn club, has earned the name ‘Serial Entrepreneur’. After pulling off his venture with FreeCharge, instead of sticking to his already invested company, he took the risk of playing the big hand — investing in other startups. That resulted in so much exposure that he got recognized by the wealthy investors for his upcoming ideas, &#8216;CRED&#8217; stood out as one of them. He acquired funding especially for CRED even long before when they hit any recommendable record. It was possible because of the investors that could rely on Shah based on his brilliant capability.

<p>The cutting-edge marketing strategies by casting renowned faces have been a part of the advertising history for a long time now. Adding up to that, severely targetted content is CRED&#8217;s trump card. We all vividly remember how the Rahul Dravid campaign went viral!</p>



<h4>Diversified Products</h4>



<p>The enlarged operations held by CRED are their asset slowly extending the community. Some of them include:</p>



<h4>CRED Cash</h4>



<p>With this product, CRED members are pre-approved for up to Rs 5,00,000. No documents are required. Nor physical visits. In 3 easy steps, members can enjoy this facility.</p>

<p>The CRED Community by far has the edgiest startup history in India. Their strong entrepreneurship appears promising and as the founder laid himself: “The best way to visualize what CRED is going to become is a large gated community or club, with chosen customers who are creditworthy for a select audience, and will never be the app that caters to hundreds of millions of customers. It will have top 20-30 million families using products and services, creating interesting experiences. Once we create a community of trust and like-mindedness, we will remove the line between fintech and lifestyle and serve their needs.”</p>
