Endorsements sprinkled by Elon Musk and Edward Snowden, of course, the shift took the world by storm. And people could see why it was the best option out of the two, hence a wave of more than 7 million downloads was observed in a week&#8217;s duration since WhatsApp&#8217;s leaks in their privacy policy. Telegram, another end-to-end encrypted cloud messaging app received millions of downloads in the wail of keeping the world&#8217;s data private.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">A tale as old as time&#8230; <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/Fz0btan8vz\">pic.twitter.com\/Fz0btan8vz<\/a><\/p>\u2014 Signal (@signalapp) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/signalapp\/status\/1442921984250109955?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">September 28, 2021<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">&#8220;We work with Facebook to offer new products and services&#8230;&#8221; \u2014 WhatsApp (2021)<br><br>&#8220;Yeah, but your [data] scientists were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, that they didn&#8217;t stop to think if they should.&#8221; \u2014 Dr. Ian Malcolm, Jurassic Park (1993) <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/pSzmnySALu\">pic.twitter.com\/pSzmnySALu<\/a><\/p>\u2014 Signal (@signalapp) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/signalapp\/status\/1375172667880316929?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">March 25, 2021<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Stay private every day of the week, not just on The Weeknd. <a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/gDOflNvG9S\">pic.twitter.com\/gDOflNvG9S<\/a><\/p>\u2014 Signal (@signalapp) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/signalapp\/status\/1358903379515199488?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 8, 2021<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">January just ended, but if one of your New Year&#8217;s Resolutions was to break up with Facebook there is still plenty of time.<\/p>\u2014 Signal (@signalapp) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/signalapp\/status\/1356415992486793216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 2, 2021<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">\ud83c\udfb5 I said, no, no, you&#8217;re not the one for me (WhatsApp) \ud83c\udfb6<a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/HEiYnMWYeL\">https:\/\/t.co\/HEiYnMWYeL<\/a><a href=\"https:\/\/t.co\/xsCdUxAvEi\">https:\/\/t.co\/xsCdUxAvEi<\/a><\/p>\u2014 Signal (@signalapp) <a href=\"https:\/\/twitter.com\/signalapp\/status\/1349058005241720832?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 12, 2021<\/a><\/blockquote> <script async=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/platform.twitter.com\/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"><\/script>\n\n\n\n<p><\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Have You Met, CRED Yet?<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<p>CRED has always provoked the mass with its not-so-subtle advertising!
