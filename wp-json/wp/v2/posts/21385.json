The founder Mr. Kunal Shah, who by making CRED the sixth and the only Indian startup to enter the 2021 unicorn club, has earned the name \u2018Serial Entrepreneur\u2019. After pulling off his venture with FreeCharge, instead of sticking to his already invested company, he took the risk of playing the big hand \u2014 investing in other startups. That resulted in so much exposure that he got recognized by the wealthy investors for his upcoming ideas, &#8216;CRED&#8217; stood out as one of them. He acquired funding especially for CRED even long before when they hit any recommendable record. It was possible because of the investors that could rely on Shah based on his brilliant capability. At present, CRED has a total of 28 investors, and 7 of them are lead investors.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>In-CRED-ibly Aesthetic Interface<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"640\" src=\"https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ui-1024x640.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21404\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ui-1024x640.png 1024w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ui-300x188.png 300w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ui-768x480.png 768w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ui-1536x960.png 1536w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ui-2048x1280.png 2048w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ui-500x313.png 500w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ui-800x500.png 800w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ui-1280x800.png 1280w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/ui-1920x1200.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Source: blog.cred.club<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>In the sea of colorful and bold designs, users find CRED&#8217;s minimalistic design more appealing.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h4>Thrilling Marketing Strategy<\/h4>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/marketing-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-21406\" srcset=\"https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/marketing-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/marketing-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/marketing-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/marketing-1536x864.png 1536w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/marketing-500x281.png 500w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/marketing-800x450.png 800w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/marketing-1280x720.png 1280w, https:\/\/thinksurfmedia.com\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/marketing.png 1920w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>Source: feeds.abplive.com<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<p>The cutting-edge marketing strategies by casting renowned faces have been a part of the advertising history for a long time now.

It will have top 20-30 million families using products and services, creating interesting experiences.
